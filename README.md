# BarberEase_Management_System
This project, titled "BarberEase Management", was developed using Java Swing and Sqlite with a simple but powerful goal to streamline the day-to-day operations of a barber shop through a user-friendly and efficient desktop application. It’s not just about automation — it’s about making the entire management process smooth, organized, and visually intuitive.

Built using Java Swing for a modern, responsive user interface, and SQLite as a lightweight, reliable
backend database, the application provides the following key features:
    • Schedule and manage customer appointments
    • Maintain client records and service history
    • Track services offered, including pricing and staff involved
    • View business performance using graphical reports
    • Organize staff schedules and daily bookings
